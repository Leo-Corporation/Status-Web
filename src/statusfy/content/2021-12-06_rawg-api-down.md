Here what's new since the last update:

- Gavilya's update system is working as expected, and there is no issues about it.
- We have changed the severity to "Partial outage" since all of Gavilya's services except RAWG are working and performing as expected.
- We won't update this status page until next day, the issue may take some time to resolve.
- This issue is **NOT** related to any LÃ©o Corporation's service.

We are closely monitoring the situation and we'll keep you updated about any significant development.

#### How Gavilya is affected
Since the API isn't currently available, you'll see lots of error messages if you have linked your games to the RAWG database. This issue shouldn't however, cause a crash of the app.
